    <body> Users of HTML  are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them litle control over the way that 
        page is displayed , <br> It should be remembered that HTML  was developed as a means of marking up
        the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation , <p> Formatting text to 
            appear on a web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear </p> in a printed document 
            <pre>
                This 
                is 

                cool.
